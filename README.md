# SNAKE

**[SFML Required]**

## Abstract 
View below is the original look of the project 

It was my second project in C++.
This project required me to find a way to move the snake on the board and to create an algorithm to check if the snake ate food and if so it grows and its segments move smoothly on the board. 
Adding a creative mode to the game allowed me to make fun with the code. I experimented with spawning objects on the board [but unfortunately not by using class instances (this is one of the things that, from the current point of view, I could try in this project)], increasing the speed of the snake's movement, scoring bonus points and counting time. Then I added simple UI. Allowing to choose skins was also my "childish fun", I like customization, although I know that I could prepare the textures in a more memory-optimal way.

## Description 
The project consist of:
  * interactive menu:
    - game mode selection:
      - basic mode
      - creative mode 
      - customizable items 
    - highscores:
      - top ten scores updated every game and read from the .txt file
  * game window
  * message boxes:
    - a message suited to the result of the game
    
The game also includes soundtracks:
1. While clicking
2. Eating food
3. During collision
4. Multiplying score
5. Winning
6. Losing
